<!-- = Chord++ By Laurent Vanni & Nicolas Goles Domic = -->
<!-- ================================================== -->

Building the chord Engine in OSX:

$make ARCH=osx

Building the chord Engine in LINUX:

$make ARCH=linux

Installing the chord++ library ( called mymed.a for now )

$sudo make install

This should produce a libmymed.a static library which you can link to your project and copy the library headers to /usr/include/mymed/

<!-- ===================== -->
<!-- = Compile & Install = -->
<!-- ===================== -->
$make ARCH=linux		// You can also do ARCH=osx
$sudo make install		// This will install the headerfiles in /usr/include/mymed/
$make clean				// You can also specify veryclean

NOTE: You will have to put the mymed.a lib where you will use it ( you could put it somewhere in /usr/lib if you want but it's not done by default)

You can actually take a look at the file "example.c" to see a small example.

There are still some memory leaks in this project, not VERY serious ( we left it running with around
50 nodes for 3 months until it crashed from out of memory). We don't have time to isolate this
leaks, so contributions are appreciated :).
